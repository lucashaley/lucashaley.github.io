One of the first points of interest that came up when designing Turf! was how, as a mobile game that requires movement in physical space, it would be designed so that most people would be able to use it.

Again, the premise is that real people run around real space, and using the game, place virtual markers at real locations which create virtual territory, overlaid on real space. The highest aggregated rate of territory wins.

> It was immediately obvious that people who are fast on their feet would have an advantage. And also that people who are not mobile would not be able to participate in the game at all.

There is clearly nothing I could do about the relative speeds of players. Runners gonna run.
