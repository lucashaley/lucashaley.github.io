I’ve never tried digital sculpting. I’ve seen my students and peers noodling away in Zbrush, creating some awesome work. But every time I would try it, the user interface (and MacOS port) would completely turn me off.

Recently, however, I decided to give Nomad Sculpt on iOS a go. And _wow_, it’s fantastic.

Starting with a sphere, I just poked around a bit. A guy’s head? Let’s go with that.

After some time I clearly had to figure out retopologizing, but from then I was able to refine some more.
