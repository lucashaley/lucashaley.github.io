I’ve never tried digital sculpting. I’ve seen my students and peers noodling away in Zbrush, creating some awesome work. But every time I would try it, the user interface (and MacOS port) would completely turn me off.

Recently, however, I decided to give Nomad Sculpt on iOS a go. And _wow_, it’s fantastic.
