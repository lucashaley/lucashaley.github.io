## Massey University

At Massey University in Wellington, NZ, I was both Programme (Department) Lead and Senior Lecturer. The majority of my work there was setting up a new department in Screen Arts (animation, film, VFX, games, creative technology), including a vast amount of academic development.

For any given year, there were 12 - 18 student capstone teams. My role was to shepherd those projects through ideation, development, preproduction, production, postproduction, and delivery. Each team self-formed, and worked with a staff mentor. The projects below are ones in which I was also the mentor.

### Best Awards

A lot of our projects were nominated or received awards from the Best Awards, the regional annual design competition.

> Brought to you by The Designers Institute of New Zealand, The Best Design Awards is an annual showcase of excellence in graphic, spatial, product, digital and motion design along with three special awards - Value of Design, Public Good and Toitanga.

You can find more samples from our programme on their website, including [Blume](https://bestawards.co.nz/digital/student-digital/massey-university-college-of-creative-arts/blume/), [The Train of Many Stations](https://bestawards.co.nz/digital/student-digital/massey-university-college-of-creative-arts/the-train-of-many-stations/), [Night Lights](https://bestawards.co.nz/moving-image/student-moving-image/massey-university-college-of-creative-arts/night-lights/), and [Smoke and Mirrors](https://bestawards.co.nz/moving-image/student-moving-image/massey-university-college-of-creative-arts/smoke-and-mirrors/).

### 2020
#### Festimals

[Finalist, Best Awards](https://bestawards.co.nz/digital/student-digital/massey-university-college-of-creative-arts/festimals/)

This was a little project that could -- a tiny team, completely dedicated to an ambitious project to create both a framework for childrens' game delivery, and a selection of sample games.

### 2019

2019 was the first year of students that graduated from the degree I helped to create, so it has a special place for me. The works from this year were proof of the success of the degree, and demonstrated the potential yet to reach.
