## Massey University

At Massey University in Wellington, NZ, I was both Programme (Department) Lead and Senior Lecturer. The majority of my work there was setting up a new department in Screen Arts (animation, film, VFX, games, creative technology), including a vast amount of academic development. The samples below are both from my direct instruction, and as the Lead.

This was a little project that could -- a tiny team, completely dedicated to an ambitious project to create both a framework for childrens' game delivery, and a selection of sample games.
