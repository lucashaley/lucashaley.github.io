I've posted before about my high school History of Art teacher, [Robert Orme](https://www.lucashaley.com/amp/robert-orme.html). The other incredibly formative teacher I had at high school was a gentleman named Stuart Dorrian.

He started at the school after me. I remember when he first strode into the room, dropping his leather satchel on the desk and confidently calling out "Alrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrright lads" in his dense scottish brogue. I had never seen anything like him. And knowing what I know now about joining a new class of kids, his entrance was pure gold.

He taught English. He did it very well. He wasn't afraid of **any** topic, and challenged us all to be fair, open-minded people. His readings of texts were dense and insightful – I still have vivid memories of working through [Graham Swift's Waterland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waterland_(novel)). He was the first person I knew who made talking about homosexuality not a big deal, which for a sheltered 14 year-old, was a big deal in and of itself. He was funny as hell, in a very wry way.

He was also the one teacher to made the transition from grade school teacher to young adult teacher effortless. Even though I stopped having him as a teacher, I would seek him out to say hi when I could. I remember one day – the last of classes for the year – when I went to go wish him a happy summer break. The kids in his class were rambunctiously out of control as they packed up to leave for the year. I asked if he was okay, and without a word he gently opened his leather satchel to reveal a small bottle of whiskey. "Oh, I'll be fine," he said with a wink.

As far as I can tell, he's now the head of one of the departments at school. He would be awesome at it.

So hat's off to Stuart Dorrian. I would be lucky to be the teacher he is.
