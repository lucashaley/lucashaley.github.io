In my work with both game development and contract animation, I often find myself in a position where I have to argue for paying for voice acting. For some reason, clients seem to feel that voice acting is something anyone can do ("can't _you_ just do it?"), or that it's an easy skill (and therefore shouldn't be expensive).

<p style="text-align: start">Conversely, I've met quite a few people wanting to be voice actors, and expecting to get work just because they have an USB microphone and a laptop.</p><p style="text-align: start"><em>Good voice acting is difficult.&nbsp;</em>And it's totally worth the cost.</p><p style="text-align: start">I was just reminded of this by the game <strong>Gun Monkeys</strong> from <a href="http://www.sizefivegames.com">Size Five Games</a>. The game itself is a pretty cute competitive side-scroller about flinging monkeys into the future. They brought on&nbsp;<a href="http://www.sizefivegames.com">The Actor Kevin Eldon</a> to narrate the game. It was a great move -- his voice takes the game to a new level, adding personality and charm throughout.</p>
