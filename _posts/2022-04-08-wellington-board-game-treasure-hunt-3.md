This one was pretty special for me. I did a lot of wandering around looking for a good spot up in Mt. Victoria park, and collecting clue photos. But when I got back to the car, my keys were missing! I had to retrace all my steps through the bush, and totally luckily found them again. A one-in-a-million chance.

I got a little more tricky with the clues -- instead of just showing the location, I had four locations create a X that marked the spot. Unfortunately I didn't realise there are _two_ beachfront empanada places in Wellington. Who would have thought.

Then the hunt itself was great -- it seemed like nobody was going to find it, but then in the middle of the night some fellows tracked it down. Their videos were awesome.
