There are quite a lot of things in New Zealand that are relatively much more expensive than other places. Mainly because they have to be shipped there from overseas, but also because the population is quite small. Like, smaller than Pheonix, AZ.

One of those things are board games. They can be almost twice as much as back in the USA, and that can be quite prohibitive. So there's quite a robust resale market, mostly on Facebook.

I'm quite lazy, however. And the idea of boxing things up and shipping them is a bit of a drag. So I decided to just leave spare games around the city. Just lying around. For people to find.

To make it more interesting, to those Facebook resale channels I post clues. Usually the game is found in the first few hours. Here's the first one.
