I'm a big fan of the RPG [Dungeon Crawl Classics](http://goodman-games.com/dungeon-crawl-classics-rpg/), which has a really engaged group of players. Every year, a bunch of people get together and make a free zine called [The Gongfarmer's Almanac](https://gongfarmersalmanac.com/), filled with all sorts of goodies.

This year I've thrown my hat in the ring to help out. I don't have a lot of free time, so the work I did tended to be sketching on the bus or in meetings. The work ended up being kind of rough and high-contrast, which I feel matches the DIY photocopied zine vibe.
