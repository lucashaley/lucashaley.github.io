While I was working as an Academic Advisor for Epic Games, one of my pet projects was to write a guide on how to get started with version control -- Perforce Helix and Git.

It was quite a project -- there was a lot of research, checking over exactly how to walk through all the weird server and software steps. And getting screenshots!

Ultimately, my tenure with Epic was over before the guide was completed -- the last 5% of detail, and all the formatting. Luckily, Diana Diriwaechter picked up the project and pushed it through to completion.
