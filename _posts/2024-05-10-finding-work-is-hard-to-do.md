I've recently moved back to the US after living in Aotearoa New Zealand. While there, I tried hard to put down roots, and establish some sort of career stability. That was not to be, however, as it became clear that I would be able to help family better being back in Portland.

Returning to Portland has not been easy, from a career standpoint. And it has had me thinking about the nature of careers in academia and tech industries.

I've always been a learner. I'm good at grasping concepts and ideas, and figuring out different ways of applying them. But I've also always been curious about too many things. So I've ended up with a very broad understanding of a bunch of things, but haven't had the opportunity to really dig deep into anything -- except teaching.

I'm a good teacher. Because I've always been a learner. Understanding where your students are coming from is critical in getting them to learn. Because ultimately, there is _no teaching, only learning_. There's nothing I can do to get someone to learn something, who isn't interested in that learning.[^1] Also, generally I love the stuff I'm teaching, and that shows.

But the problem with teaching is that that career toolset doesn't carry outside of the discipline. Of course, _it should_, but in reality it doesn't provide you with the portfolio to step away from teaching. Yes, I can absolutely do the job, but can I show that I can? I can show that I've taught other people how to do it, but that doesn't wash. And I understand that. I also understand that there are probably 100 other people applying, who have prior credits, who have portfolios. Bless them.

So I'm in a bit of an emotional gully these days. I'd like to take the time to build a portfolio of work that I can be proud to show, but there are bills to pay.

[^1]: And vice versa -- there's nothing I can do to stop someone learning something, who has the gumption to learn it.
