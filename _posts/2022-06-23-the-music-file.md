I got my first guitar when I was about 14 or 15. At the time I was living in London, UK, and didn't have that close of a social circle. I didn't really go out, and I got quite focused on learning to play guitar.

At the time there wasn't an internet, and the bulk of how I learned was from various US-based guitar magazines that would come out every month. They would feature little tutorials and complete transcriptions to songs -- songs that often I would never had heard before (again, no internet). It was an interesting way to learn.

In my hyperfocused learning, I would pull out the good bits of each magazine, and add them to a binder. I would transcribe my own versions from shitty cassette tapes. This binder grew quite large.

Recently we've been packing things up, and relentlessly downsizing stuff. But what can I possibly do with this? This was my bible when I was 16. Nobody else could possibly find it useful these days.

I think it might need a viking funeral.
