I think one of the interesting side effects of being in New Zealand during Covid-19 is that people are looking closer to home for everything – at least in Aotearoa, where we're in a small Covid-free bubble of our own. So here's another homegrown scientist!

[Dr. Ngaio Beausoleil](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Ngaio_Beausoleil) also works at Massey University, but unlike me at the artsy Wellington campus, she's on the agri nexus of New Zealand, Palmerston North. I found out about her work while researching for my suspended [Herdr](https://www.lucashaley.com/tag/sheep/) project, and have continued to be in awe of her research output quality and volume.

A _ngaio_ is a lovely kind of tree endemic to Aotearoa. It looks like this:

She shares the same given name as [Ngaio Marsh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ngaio_Marsh), New Zealand's Agatha Christie.
