For a small research project I've been trying to get realtime location and maps in Unity. There are a lot of different options, but I've been poking around mostly with [MapBox](https://mapbox.com/). They have an UnityPackage that seems robust, but I had a time with getting rid of the compile errors. The post that helped was [here](https://forum.unity.com/threads/arcore-sdk-console-error-spatialtracking-does-not-exist-in-the-namespace-unityengine.531243/), especially the bits about the **XR Legacy Input Helpers** package.

This is just a selfish post to remind me.
