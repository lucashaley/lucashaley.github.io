Several years ago I made a map of [Siwal](http://www.lucashaley.com/siwal/) for [Kobold Press](http://www.koboldpress.com). As of a couple weeks ago, their new book [Southlands](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/350683997/southlands-new-fantasy-options-for-pathfinder-rpg)Â was very, very successfully kickstarted. 

This book expands upon the realm surrounding Siwal, encompassing savannas, jungles, deserts, and more. I'm excited to say that I've been asked to contribute at least three more maps to the book, all full page and full color.
