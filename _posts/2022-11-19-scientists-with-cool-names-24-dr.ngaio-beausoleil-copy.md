So I couldn't find an image that I could confirm was Homer Clyde Snook, which is a shame.

But regardless, he was a physicist working in the field of roentgen rays, soon to be relabeled x-rays. Working for the Victor company, he made the delightfully-titled "Snook Apparatus", an early device to create x-rays.

I mean, look at this thing:

And check this out: at the start of World War II, he registered for the draft. _He was 64 at the time._ What a champ.
