[John Savio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Savio) was a Norwegian artist of the early 20th century. While he died young and rather destitute, his work lives on. Because it's gorgeous.

I don't know why I'm so into woodcuts and linocuts recently. [I made some for my family for Christmas](https://lucashaley.github.io/christmas-linocuts/), perhaps I should post those.
