I just had a lovely studio visit from [Bean Gilsdorf](http://www.beangilsdorf.com). The process of a studio visit is fascinating -- two people, who probably have never met each other, get together and talk. Things like that should happen with more frequency. And happen across disciplines.

We only had half an hour to chat, so we didn't get too in-depth, but I was excited to hear her thoughts about how to get the most out of grad school, ideas on submitting proposals for writing, and about the importance of just getting out there and talking with people. It's given me more impetus to get deeper into the Portland art scene, and see what's going on around here.
I would strongly recommend anyone take a look at Bean's work, and especially to check out her column <a href="http://dailyserving.com/tag/help-desk/">Help Desk</a> with the <a href="http://dailyserving.com/">Daily Serving.</a>
