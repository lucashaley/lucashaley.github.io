During my Game Design and Play class, I'll often set an in-class assignment to design a game. These assignments come with restrictions, which I use to try to get my students to think about rules and elements in a different way. I also take up the challenge, and sometimes I get something I really like.

This last week the assignment was to make a game using a standard deck of cards, with the face cards removed. Here is what I came up with. I think it's pretty good.
