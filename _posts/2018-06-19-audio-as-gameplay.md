excerpt: When sounds make the game.
---

For a group show opening in December I am creating an audio experiential game world. The idea is that there are no visuals for the game -- the player needs to navigate a world using only 3d positional audio. I will attempt to create a narrative from the movement and interaction of the player in this world.

In researching my concept, I came across this article on [Audio as Gameplay](http://gamestudies.org/1301/articles/oldenburg_sonic_mechanics) by Aaron Oldenburg. Good stuff.
