## Research

My research is primarily focused on exploring the meaning behind our mediated modern lives through the technology that increasingly defines us. My work uses bleeding-edge tech to explore how we can maintain our humanity and social connections in spite of that same technology.

## Instruction

### Background

Over the last eight years I have been teaching digital art, animation, game design and coding. It's tremendously rewarding. I've taught at the [Pacific Northwest College of Art](https://www.lucashaley.com/www.pnca.edu), the [Art Institute of Portland](https://www.lucashaley.com/www.aii.edu), and I am currently Senior Lecturer and Programme Lead at [Massey University](http://creative.massey.ac.nz/) in Wellington, New Zealand.

### Philosophy

My own academic background is deeply rooted in Liberal Arts. Starting with my schooling at [Latymer Upper School](http://www.latymer-upper.org/) in England, and tempered at [Reed College](https://www.lucashaley.com/www.reed.edu) in Portland, Oregon, and capped with an MFA from [PNCA](http://www.pnca.edu/), my direct experience of education has been broad, rigorous, and holistic. It is my intention to provide that same approach in my own teaching.

The classes I teach cover a wide range of experience, from absolute beginner classes all the way to leading final graduating group projects. I tailor my approach to individual classes and to the students that compromise them. My role as teacher changes: in introductory classes my approach is decidedly sophistic, questioning preconceived notions and ideas, trying to prepare the students to open their minds; in intermediate classes I focus on skillsets and practical knowledge; in the advanced classes, where students have developed a great deal of skill, my approach is trusting and exploratory.

While the majority of the classes I teach are principally technical classes, it is my intention to extend the learning experience beyond the functional knowledge needed. I am able to draw upon my art history background, grounding even the most modern work in a deep historical context; my professional experience as both a programmer and an artist allows me to straddle those disciplines, bringing formal logic to art classes, and a creative flair to programming classes.

## Music

I used to play bass for the mighty pirate band for buccaneers of all ages, Captain Bogg & Salty. We were together for about eleven years, playing for kids and adults, at libraries, schools, clubs, trailer parks, and malls.
