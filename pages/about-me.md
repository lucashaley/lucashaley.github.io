## Research

My research is primarily focused on exploring the meaning behind our mediated modern lives through the technology that increasingly defines us. My work uses bleeding-edge tech to explore how we can maintain our humanity and social connections in spite of that same technology.

## Instruction

### Background

Since 2008 I have been teaching digital art, animation, game design and coding. It's tremendously rewarding. I've taught at the [Pacific Northwest College of Art](https://www.lucashaley.com/www.pnca.edu), the [Art Institute of Portland](https://www.lucashaley.com/www.aii.edu), and I am currently Senior Lecturer and Programme Lead at [Massey University](http://creative.massey.ac.nz/) in Wellington, New Zealand.

### Philosophy

My own academic background is deeply rooted in Liberal Arts. Starting with my schooling at [Latymer Upper School](http://www.latymer-upper.org/) in England, and tempered at [Reed College](https://www.lucashaley.com/www.reed.edu) in Portland, Oregon, and capped with an MFA from [PNCA](http://www.pnca.edu/), my direct experience of education has been broad, rigorous, and holistic. It is my intention to provide that same approach in my own teaching.

The classes I teach cover a wide range of experience, from absolute beginner classes all the way to leading final graduating group projects. I tailor my approach to individual classes and to the students that compromise them. My role as teacher changes: in introductory classes my approach is decidedly sophistic, questioning preconceived notions and ideas, trying to prepare the students to open their minds; in intermediate classes I focus on skillsets and practical knowledge; in the advanced classes, where students have developed a great deal of skill, my approach is trusting and exploratory.

While the majority of the classes I teach are principally technical classes, it is my intention to extend the learning experience beyond the functional knowledge needed. I am able to draw upon my art history background, grounding even the most modern work in a deep historical context; my professional experience as both a programmer and an artist allows me to straddle those disciplines, bringing formal logic to art classes, and a creative flair to programming classes.

## Music

I used to play bass for the mighty pirate band for buccaneers of all ages, Captain Bogg & Salty. We were together for about eleven years, playing for kids and adults, at libraries, schools, clubs, trailer parks, and malls.

In all, we released four albums. You can find them on Amazon.com and CDbaby.com.
